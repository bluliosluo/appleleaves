# Apple Leaves

The plant pathology is an important problem of research interest. The plant
pathology challenge 2020 focuses on training a model to classify foliar
diseases of apples given the photos of the apple leaves. In this task, data
insufficiency and data imbalance should be addressed. To tackle with the
above issues, we implement a series of data augmentation operations
including illumination, contrast adjustment, flipping, rotation, cropping and
blurring to enrich the dataset. We use ResNet as the model framework and
use 5-fold cross validation to train the model. Experiment results show that
the proposed methods can achieve good results.
